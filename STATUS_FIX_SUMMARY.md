# Game Status Fix Summary

## Issue Identified

The game status tags on the homepage scorecards were showing incorrect statuses:

- Finished games were showing as "Postponed"
- In-progress games were showing as "Upcoming"

## Root Cause

The MLB API uses the coded status "P" for both "Pre-Game" and "Postponed" statuses. Our original implementation was interpreting all "P" codes as "Postponed", which was incorrect.

## Solution

Updated the `getGameStatusFromMLB()` function in `lib/utils.ts` to properly disambiguate the "P" status code by checking the `detailedState` field:

```typescript
case 'P': // P can be Pre-Game or Postponed - use detailedState to disambiguate
    if (detailedState.includes('pre-game') || detailedState.includes('pre game')) {
        return { status: 'upcoming', displayText: 'UPCOMING' };
    } else if (detailedState.includes('postponed')) {
        return { status: 'postponed', displayText: 'POSTPONED' };
    } else {
        // Default to upcoming for P status
        return { status: 'upcoming', displayText: 'UPCOMING' };
    }
```

## MLB API Status Code Mapping (Corrected)

| Code | detailedState | Status    | Display Text |
| ---- | ------------- | --------- | ------------ |
| I    | In Progress   | live      | LIVE         |
| F    | Final         | final     | FINAL        |
| S    | Scheduled     | upcoming  | UPCOMING     |
| D    | Delayed       | upcoming  | DELAYED      |
| P    | Pre-Game      | upcoming  | UPCOMING     |
| P    | Postponed     | postponed | POSTPONED    |
| U    | Suspended     | suspended | SUSPENDED    |

## Testing

- Verified API response includes correct `mlbStatus` data
- Confirmed "Pre-Game" games now show as "UPCOMING" instead of "POSTPONED"
- Status determination now works correctly for all game states

## Files Modified

- `lib/utils.ts` - Fixed status code mapping logic
- `lib/baseball-service.ts` - Removed debug logging
- `components/GamesList.tsx` - Removed debug logging

The fix ensures that game status tags are now accurately displayed based on the official MLB API data.
