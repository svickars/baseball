# Game Status Update Summary

## Overview

Updated the game status handling throughout the site to use MLB API status data instead of relying on calculated upcoming vs live logic. This provides more reliable and accurate game status information.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Utility Functions (`lib/utils.ts`)

- Added `getGameStatusFromMLB()` function that uses MLB API's `codedGameState` and `detailedState` fields
- Updated existing `isGameLive()`, `isGameFinal()`, and `isGameUpcoming()` functions to use MLB API data when available
- Added fallback to legacy logic for backward compatibility

### 2. Updated Game Interface (`types/index.ts`)

- Added `mlbStatus` field to the `Game` interface to store MLB API status data
- Includes `detailedState` and `codedGameState` from the MLB API

### 3. Enhanced Baseball Service (`lib/baseball-service.ts`)

- Modified `getGamesForDate()` to include MLB API status data in Game objects
- Now stores both `detailedState` and `codedGameState` from the MLB API response

### 4. Updated Components

#### GamesList Component (`components/GamesList.tsx`)

- Now uses `getGameStatusFromMLB()` for more reliable status determination
- Displays status based on MLB API data with fallback to legacy logic

#### GamePage Component (`components/GamePage.tsx`)

- Updated status display logic to use MLB API data
- Maintains consistency with homepage status display

#### Homepage (`app/page.tsx`)

- Updated live game detection to use MLB API status data
- More reliable determination of which games are currently live

## MLB API Status Codes Used

| Code | Status      | Display Text |
| ---- | ----------- | ------------ |
| I    | In Progress | LIVE         |
| F    | Final       | FINAL        |
| S    | Scheduled   | UPCOMING     |
| D    | Delayed     | DELAYED      |
| P    | Postponed   | POSTPONED    |
| U    | Suspended   | SUSPENDED    |

## Benefits

1. **More Reliable**: Uses official MLB API status codes instead of string parsing
2. **Consistent**: Same status logic across all components
3. **Accurate**: Handles edge cases like delayed, postponed, and suspended games
4. **Backward Compatible**: Falls back to legacy logic if MLB API data is not available
5. **Future-Proof**: Easy to extend for additional status types

## Testing

Created a test script (`test-status.js`) to verify the new status functions work correctly with various MLB API status codes.
